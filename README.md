# Research Collaboration Channel

This repository serves as a **secure and public contact point** for scientific and technical collaboration inquiries related to:

- AI-driven discovery of room-temperature superconductors  
- Offline AI systems for quantum materials research  
- Nanoscale engineering of correlated electron states  

I am **Stanislav Kravchenko**, an independent researcher based in Russia, working at the intersection of semiconductor physics, BCS theory, and lightweight AI.

🔍 **My current hypothesis**:  
> Crystalline silicon dioxide (SiO₂), when doped in a chessboard pattern with 47–112 nm periodicity, may host Cooper pairs under ambient conditions via externally engineered carrier correlation — not intrinsic phase transition.
