# Research Collaboration Channel

This repository serves as a secure and public contact point for scientific collaboration related to AI-driven discovery of room-temperature superconductivity in engineered SiO₂.

I am Stanislav Kravchenko, an independent researcher in quantum materials. My hypothesis: chessboard-patterned doping of SiO₂ at 47–112 nm may enable Cooper pair formation under ambient conditions via externally engineered carrier correlation (BCS-compatible).

All work is conducted offline. For collaboration inquiries, please open an Issue.
